# TLS with PAKE

### SETUP

Create a python venv named localenv

`python3 -m venv localenv`

Enter your python venv using `source ./env` (I've included a bash script `env` which you can use to quickly enter your virtual env, make sure you name your venv `localenv` as well! If you name your venv anything other than `localenv` make sure to edit the `env` bash script)

Install libraries 

`pip -r requirements.txt`
